Skyward Experimental Rocketry
=============================
- Inside the "R2A_Simulator" folder there is the effective GUI exe programme.
  - "for_redistribution_files_only" contains "R2A_Simulator.exe" which can be executed if MATLAB
    runtime is installed with the proper version.
  - "for_redistribution" contains "MyAppInstaller_web.exe" which installs the GUI with ALL the
    required software.

- In order to edit the GUI use the same programme used for its creation "MATLAB GUIDE"
  REMEMBER to include all the necessary files.
